I use the singleton pattern for this java application.

The Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern is a creation pattern, which provides the best way to create objects. This pattern involves a single class, which is responsible for creating its own objects, while ensuring that only a single object is created. The class provides a way to access its unique objects directly, without instantiating objects of the class.

Advantages:
Singleton Pattem pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern is a creation pattern, which provides the best way to create objects.
It provides the best way to create objects. This pattern involves a single class, which is responsible for creating its own objects, while ensuring that only a single object is created. This class provides a way to access its unique object
that can be accessed directly, without instantiating objects of the class.
Advantages:
.1. Only one instance in memory, reducing memory overhead, especially for frequent creation and destruction of instances (e.g., managing the college home page cache).
.2. Avoid multiple occupation of resources (e.g., write file operations).
